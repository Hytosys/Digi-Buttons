Voluntary work done for Hit Box Arcade used to monitor the input of their
gaming controllers. Done in Java for multiple platform support, but has a
low-level keyboard hook implementation specifically for Windows using the Java
Native Access library. Allows for interface customization through property
files and flat image files in an external resources folder.
